The Arborist provides a fast, open-source implementation of Leo Brieman's Random Forest algorithm. The Arborist achieves its speed through efficient C++ code and parallel, distributed tree construction. 

Bindings are available for [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rborist/index.html) and **Python (evolving)**


### R

The *Arborist* is available on CRAN as the [Rborist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rborist/index.html) package. 

Installation of Release Version:

    > install.packages('Rborist')

Installation of Development Version:

    > ./ArboristBridgeR/Package/Rborist.CRAN.sh
    > R CMD INSTALL Rborist_*.*-*.tar.gz


#### Notes
- Rborist version 0.1-16 uploaded to CRAN, awaiting build confirmations.
- Rborist version 0.2-0 under development.

### Python

 - Some users reporting successful training and prediction.
 - Out-of-bag validation NYI.
 - Contributors sought.
 - Test cases sought.

### Performance 

Performance metrics will be measured soon using [benchm-ml](https://github.com/szilard/benchm-ml). Partial results can be found [here](https://github.com/szilard/benchm-ml/tree/master/z-other-tools)

### News/Changes
- New option 'nThread' enables specification of OpenMP thread count.
- New option 'oob' constrains prediction to the out-of-bag set, essential for variable importance testing.
- Improved memory footprint.

Correctness errors are addressed as received.
